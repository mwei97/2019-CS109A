But in a nutshell, what they say is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Normalization (which makes your data go from 0-1) is widely used in image processing and computer vision, where pixel intensities are non-negative and are typically scaled from a 0-255 scale to a 0-1 range for a lot of different algorithms. \n",
    "2. Normalization is also very useful in neural networks (which we will see later in the course) as it leads to the algorithms converging faster.\n",
    "3. Normalization is useful when your data does not have a discernible distribution and you are not making assumptions about your data's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of Standardization**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardization maintains outliers (do you see why?) whereas normalization makes outliers less obvious. In applications where outliers are useful, standardization should be done.\n",
    "2. Standardization is useful when you assume your data comes from a Gaussian distribution (or something that is approximately Gaussian). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some General Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We learn parameters for standardization ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) and for normalization ($x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$). Make sure these parameters are learned on the training set i.e use the training set parameters even when normalizing/standardizing the test set. In sklearn terms, fit your scaler on the training set and use the scaler to transform your test set and validation set (**don't re-fit your scaler on test set data!**).\n",
    "2. The point of standardization and normalization is to make your variables take on a more manageable scale. You should ideally standardize or normalize all your variables at the same time. \n",
    "3. Standardization and normalization is not always needed and is not an automatic thing you have to do on any data science homework!! Do so sparingly and try to justify why this is needed.\n",

Otherwise, the intercept is interpreted as the expected value of 𝑌𝑖 when the predictors are set to 0, which may not be a realistic or interpretable situation (e.g. what if the predictors were height and weight?)\n",

We control the amount of regularization using a parameter $\\lambda$. **NOTE**: sklearn's [ridge regression package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html) represents this $\\lambda$ using a parameter alpha. In Ridge Regression, the penalty term is proportional to the L2-norm of the coefficients. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Since Lasso regression tend to produce zero estimates for a number of model parameters - we say that Lasso solutions are **sparse** - we consider to be a method for variable selection.\n",
    "2. In Ridge Regression, the penalty term is proportional to the L2-norm of the coefficients whereas in Lasso Regression, the penalty term is proportional to the L1-norm of the coefficients.\n",
    "3. Ridge Regression has a closed form solution! Lasso Regression does not. We often have to solve this iteratively. In the sklearn package for Lasso regression, there is a parameter called `max_iter` that determines how many iterations we perform. \n",

    "### Why Standardizing Variables was not a waste of time\n",
